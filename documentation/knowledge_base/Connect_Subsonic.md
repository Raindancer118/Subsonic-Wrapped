# Adding Subsonic Servers

You can connect multiple Subsonic-compatible servers (Navidrome, Gonic, Airsonic, etc.) to aggregate your stats.

1.  Go to the **Connections** tab in Settings.
2.  In the "Subsonic Servers" section, click **Add Server**.
3.  Enter your:
    *   **Server URL**: e.g. `https://music.example.com`
    *   **Username**: Your username on that server.
    *   **Password**: Your password (or App Password).
4.  Click **Save**.

The system will verify the connection. If successful, it will immediately start polling for "Now Playing" status to track your listening time.
