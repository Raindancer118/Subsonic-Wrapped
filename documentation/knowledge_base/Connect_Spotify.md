# Connecting Spotify

To import your listening history from Spotify, you need to link your account.

1.  Go to the **Connections** tab in Settings.
2.  Click **Connect with Spotify**.
3.  You will be redirected to Spotify to login and authorize the application.
4.  Once redirected back, your "Recently Played" tracks will begin syncing automatically.

**Note**: Spotify only allows fetching the last 50 tracks. We poll frequently to capture as much as possible, but gaps may occur if you listen to many tracks offline.
